            <li class="list"> Learning vs winning the system  </li>
            <p class="brief"> Since the day we are born learning starts and its a lifelong process. To be an efficient learner, the focus must shift from winning a system to actual long term learning. Here is the great article that describe it best. <a href='http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html'>The Lesson to Unlearn</a> </p>
            

            <li class="list"> What is success?  </li>
            <p class="brief"> Drive and persistance leads to success. To succeed we need to take risks and make mistakes. Those who are successful today are the risk takers and efficient learners. Hard work is essential for success but if you know the science and technologies of efficient learning you don't have to work hard. </p>
            

            <li class="list"> The Obstacles  </li>
            <p class="brief"> Most people won't take risk because of the obstacles. What you do when you encounter the obstacle will define your future success. When you feel like you suck, you found something people aren't willing to do. So get comfortable with not knowing and be curious. Obstacles are the reasons that makes your skill valuable. <a className='wikipedia' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Obstacle_Is_the_Way'>The Obstacle Is the Way</a></p>
           

            <li class="list"> The Dip </li>
            <p class="brief"> Dip is knowing what isn't working for you and being able to follow what works for you. There is a possibility that you are not simply cut out for the path ahead. It is just as important to know when to quit, to turnaround and do something different as it is to push to go over the obstacles. <a className='wikipedia' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dip'>A great book on dip.</a> </p>

            <li class="list"> Failures don't count </li>
            <p class="brief"> Everybody that you met today experiences you as you right now. Nobody care about test you failed, mistakes you made in the past. Your mistakes don't count against you. Every failure brings you closer to where you want to be. </p>

            
            <li class="list"> It's all in the frame </li>
            <p class="brief"> Frame are what human use to change perspective. Almost everything in this universe have different context or frames that you can use to view thing in different way. Framing is moving the negative ideas where we don't have control over our future into looking out from different perspective having a begineer mindset. <a className='wikipedia' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)'> Framing effect </a>  </p>

            <li class="list"> Pareto Principle </li>
            <p class="brief"> The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. <a className='wikipedia' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle'>Learn More</a> </p>

            <li class="list"> Skill stacking </li>
            <p class="brief"> Working on one skill is good but you have to understand that there is someone out there working twice as hard as you on same skill. Instead of getting good at one thing, be good at multiple things and combine them. stack your skills in different unique way, that is unique to you. To really be a master at something it requires a lifetime of dedication. There is always going to be somebody working harder than you do. With skill stacking its actually more effective to be in top 10% or 20% in serveral different skills that you can stack together that is completely unique to you so that you can be in the 5% of that skill. <a className='wikipedia' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_(book)'>Mastery (book)</a>  </p>  

            <li class="list"> Happiness Factors </li>
            <p class="brief"> The key to find all your happiness is learning and inorder to be an efficient learner you need to be happy. If you are not in the good state of mind you are automatically in disadvantage. Look at your everyday life and think about the key factors that make you happy.  </p>

            <li class="list"> Your productivity time</li>
            <p class="brief"> Figure out your productive time and structure your learning at that time. The key is that there is no-one better than other. Every person is different and our job is to figure out our productivity time. It could be in the morning or evening anytime that works for you. </p>

            <li class="list"> Self-learning paradigm </li>
            <p class="brief">The core of self-learning is the idea of personal autonomy. Nobody is going to tell you to learn the topic to develop the skill to develop further and further each day. That is the choice you have to make. </p> 

            </ul>
            <div class='key'>
            <h2 class='take-away'>Key Takeaway:</h2>
             <p class="final"> Success is the path and learning is the key. Understand the obstacle, dip, compound learning, skill stacking with a begineer mindset and find happiness factors.  </p>

                <li class="list"> Follow your passion </li>
                <p class="brief"> passion comes after you put in the hard work to become excellent at something ualuable, not before. What you do for a living is much less important than how you do it. Learn to love the process of getting better and growing. Here are some of the books of Cal Newport that will make you realise about this lie. <a href='https://www.calnewport.com/#booksSec'>His official website</a> </p>

                <li class="list"> You can avoid risk </li>
                <p class="brief"> To really achieve anything worthwhile you have to be able to tolerate and enjoy taking risks. Inorder to make exceptional discoveries of leaps in skills you need to have risks. Analyise the risk and perform the suitable solution to that risk. Remember always that you have to give up something to get another thing. </p>

                <li class="list"> Trust this one person </li>
                <p class="brief"> Don't always agree with one person. Everyone is giving advise based on their life experience. Believe nothing unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense. </p>

                <li class="list"> 10,000 hours rule </li>
                <p class="brief">Yeah, Hard work is the key to sucess but when it comes to learning practice doesn't matter that much. Other factors like genetics, personality, life history etc makes up the majority of the difference. <a href='https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/23/20828597/the-10000-hour-rule-debunked'>Learn More</a> </p>

            <h2 class="take-away">Key Takeaway</h2>
            <p class="final"> Shift your focus at being good and your passion will follow you. Risk is a part of life and those who takes risks achieve great things, discover something new. Don't trust one person or community. Gather the information and analyise yourself. If it's makes sense then it will work for you. There are different factors we should remember that affect our ability to learn. </p>

To be an efficient learner we need to have growth mindset. With enough effort and strategy we can get better at anything. When we think everything is a game, we are just improving constantly like a game character improving and providing more and more features as we play along. We can now look at the world around us as an exciting place to grow and embrace these obstacles and challenges that come our way. <a href='https://fs.blog/2015/03/carol-dweck-mindset/'>A Summary of Growth and Fixed Mindsets</a>  </p>

                <li class="list"> Feynmann Technique </li>
                <p class="brief"> The Feynman Technique is a Mental Model named after Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize Winning Physicist. It is designed as a technique to help you learn pretty much learn anything - so understand concepts you don't really get, remember stuff you have already learnt, or study more efficiently. The idea is if you really want to understand something well, you need to be able to teach it. Explaning something in a simple to understand way is the best way to actually learn but also to test your knowledge.

                <p class="brief"> The idea of trunk based knowledge is to have a strong foundation before learning new skills. Inorder to be an efficient learner we must first start from the root. We need to learn the fundamentals and than move to advance. When we know the fundamentals we can expand the everchanging knowledge. Focusing on a stable knowledge is a powerful approach to build a life around. <a href='https://medium.com/accelerated-intelligence/be-prepared-to-lose-your-job-in-the-future-if-you-dont-learn-this-one-skill-now-8a87ade2a268'> Learn More </a> </p>

            <h2 class="take-away">Key Takeaway</h2>
            <p class="final"> Life is a game and we are in total control of it. Inorder to master something we have to be able to explain it in a simple term. Focusing on a stable knowledge is a powerful approach to be more efficient. Understanding we have a limited time to live and limited skills to acquire is the best way to build a strong foundation for future. </p>

            <p class="brief"> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. <a class='wikipedia' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique'>Learn more</a> </p>  

            <li class='list'> Chunk the subject </li>
            <p class='brief'> Chunking is the idea of mental leap that helps us to unite different bits of knowledge into something meaningful or give us context in life. When we focus on something, we create chunk of knowledge. When we learn something we are creating neurons patterns and connecting them with pre-existing patterns in our long-term memory. Breaking things down into basic fundamental truth and start there. You can adopt bottom-up learning which starting small and connect the dot or Top-down learning which is to see the big picture in first.

            <li class='list'> Spaced repetition </li>
            <p class='brief'> Revisiting and practicing what you learned is important because it is the best way to build synaptic connection in our neurons. It enhances memory, problem solving, and transfer of learning to new contexts. After a certain point the neuron connections get strong enough that we don't have to repeat as often, only once in a while. We also have to remember about the forgetting curve. <a href='https://www.dartmouth.edu/~cogedlab/pubs/Kang(2016,PIBBS).pdf'> Learn More </a>  </p>

            <p class='brief'> Interleaving is a technique to use different problems and sessions to learn something. Interleaving is a very powerful concept. It is the reason as we age, we tend to become smarter. We are able to interleave different experiences in our lives and all sorts of knowledge to connect different ideas. The goal is to "mix it up". <a href='https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-interleaving-effect-mixing-it-up-boosts-learning/'> How am I going to mix up my learning?</a> </p>

            <p class='brief'> Einstellung is the development of mechanised state of mind. It is the ability to solve a given problem in a specific manner even though better or more appropriate methods of solving the problem exists. Einstellung is not having the rigid mindset. Intergrative complexity is the idea of willingness to accept multiple perspectives which helps to overcome einstellung. When learning don't stick with one resource, ask yourself what is option C and always understand there's pros and cons to everything.
